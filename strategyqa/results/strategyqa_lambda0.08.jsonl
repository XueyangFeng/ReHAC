Administration to opioid-dependent individuals may cause symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including restlessness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a fast heart rate, and sweating.[13] To prevent this, small doses every few minutes can be given until the desired effect is reached.[13] In those with previous heart disease or taking medications that negatively affect the heart, further heart problems have occurred.[13] It appears to be safe in pregnancy, after having been given to a limited number of women.[16] Naloxone is a non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist.[6][17] It works by reversing the depression of the central nervous system and respiratory system caused by opioids.[13].\n<solver> human\nThought 3: Narcan is a medication used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids, including restoring breathing after an opioid overdose.

With possible roots dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism enters recorded history around the middle of the 6th century BCE.[12] It served as the state religion of the ancient Iranian empires for more than a millennium (approximately from 600 BCE to 650 CE), but declined from the 7th century CE onwards as a direct result of the Arab-Muslim conquest of Persia (633–654 CE), which led to the large-scale persecution of the Zoroastrian people.[13] Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians in the world at around 110,000–120,000[14] at most, with the majority of this figure living in India, Iran, and North America; their number has been thought to be declining.\n<solver> agent\nThought 2: Zoroastrianism is an Iranian religion with a monotheistic ontology.
