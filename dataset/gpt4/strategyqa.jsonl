Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement, balance, and posture.[1][4] Most often, the problems occur during pregnancy, but they may also occur during childbirth or shortly after birth.[1] Often, the cause is unknown.[1] Risk factors include preterm birth, being a twin, certain infections during pregnancy, such as toxoplasmosis or rubella, exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy, a difficult delivery, and head trauma during the first few years of life, among others.[1] About 2% of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause.[5] A number of sub-types are classified, based on the specific problems present.[1] For example, those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy, those with poor coordination in locomotion have ataxic cerebral palsy, and those with writhing movements have dyskinetic cerebral palsy.[6] Diagnosis is based on the child's development over time.[1] Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes.[1].\n<solver> agent\nThought 3: I couldn't find information specifically about a young Wizard of Oz Scarecrow.
