It was the first Indian music video made using chroma key technology.[1]. The song and the video were a success in India, cementing Mehndi's status as India's biggest and most popular popstar at the time.[2] It later gained international success and garnered a cult following,[2] especially after it became an internet meme in the 2000s.[3][4]. The \"Tunak Tunak Tun\" lyrics are a reference to the sounds made by a tumbi (also called tumba), a traditional musical instrument from the Punjab region in the northern Indian subcontinent.[5] The lyrics also refer to the ektara or tuntuna.. Mehndi claims his music was often criticized for only being popular due to the abundance of beautiful, dancing women in his videos.[1] The singer responded by creating a video that featured nobody but himself.\n",

They were largely common people,[1] and the movement was widespread throughout England, though they were not organised and had no leader.[citation needed]. The chaos of the Second English Civil War, the execution of King Charles I, and the animosity between the Presbyterians and Independents during the era of the Commonwealth gave rise to many sectarian groups that attempted to make sense of their society and place within that society.

The collective \"Lords\" can refer to a group or body of peers.. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word hlāford which originated from hlāfweard meaning \"loaf-ward\" or \"bread-keeper\", reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers.[3] The appellation \"lord\" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation \"lady\" is used. This is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title previously held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lords Mayor are examples of women who are styled as \"Lord\"..

The conceptualization of Narita was highly controversial and remains so to the present day, especially among local residents in the area. This has led to the Sanrizuka Struggle, stemming from the government's decision to construct the airport without consulting most residents in the area, as well as expropriating their lands in the process. Even after the airport was eventually completed, air traffic movements have been controlled under various noise related operating restrictions due to its direct proximity with residential neighborhoods, including a house with a farm that is located right in between the runways.[4] As a result, the airport must be closed from 00:00 (12:00am) to 06:00 (6:00am) the next day to minimize the noise pollution impact around the airport.[5].\n",

While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his champions rank him highly among the under-appreciated and unjustly neglected major American writers of the 20th century.[2] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of the Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work. Stein added, \"You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men, and for some of the same reasons. On the topics of class, sex, and alcohol—that is, the topics that mattered to him—his novels amount to a secret history of American life.\"[3] His work stands out from that of his contemporary authors for its unvarnished realism.[citation needed].\n",

The first match that the AFL Commission has identified as a direct precursor to the codification of Australian football was organised and umpired by Tom Wills and contested  between Melbourne Grammar School Football Club[2] and Scotch College, on 31 July 1858 at the Richmond Paddock, adjacent to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. A follow-up match was played on 11 August 1858.[3] A match announced for 14 August 1858 did not take place; a scratch match was played instead.[4] The oldest surviving set of rules of Australian rules football were drawn up on 17 May 1859, three days after the re-formation of the Melbourne Football Club for the 1859 season. These rules were based on school football rules, but made simpler.. The earliest official formal leagues were the South Australian National Football League, originally called the South Australian Football Association, and the Victorian Football Association, both formed in 1877.\n",

The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3].

Based on a real-life story, the film centers on a taxi driver from Seoul who unintentionally becomes involved in the events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. It is based on German journalist Jürgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.. The film was released on 2 August 2017, in South Korea.[6] It was very positively received by critics, who praised its unique approach to depicting the Gwangju Uprising events, emotional weight, as well as the main character and his relationship with Hinzpeter, and was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[7][8] The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest-grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the thirteenth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[9][10]. The film centers around the Gwangju Uprising that occurred from 18 May 1980, to 27 May 1980, and it is estimated to have led to 2,000 people being killed.\n",

Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, TV network, society, or humanity at large.[1] Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.[2]. The English-language word \"community\" derives from the Old French comuneté (Modern French: communauté), which comes from the Latin communitas \"community\", \"public spirit\" (from Latin communis, \"common\").[3].\n",

Most commonly associated with horror, action, and science fiction films of the 1970s and 1980s, he is generally recognized as one of the greatest masters of the horror genre.[1] At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the French Directors' Guild gave him the Golden Coach Award, lauding him as \"a creative genius of raw, fantastic, and spectacular emotions\".[2][3]. Carpenter's early films included box office and critical successes like Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984). His other productions from the 1970s and the 1980s only later came to be considered cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. These include Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988), In the Mouth of Madness (1994), and Escape from L.A.\n",

The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,[5] before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October.. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release.[6] The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.[7].
