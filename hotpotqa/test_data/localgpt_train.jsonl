He had a love-hate relationship with Bavaria which showed itself in his work. Some of his controversial films, such as Das Gespenst (The Ghost), were presented at the Berlinale festival.. Born Herbert Schild in 1938 in Munich,[2] Achternbusch was the illegitimate son of the sports teacher Luise Schild, née Muckenthaler, and the dental technician Adolf Achternbusch.[3] He grew up in the Bavarian Forest with his grandmother.[3][4] In 1960, he was adopted by his biological father and took the name Achternbusch.[5] After his Abitur in Cham,[6] he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg, and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.[4][7]. In the early 1970s, Achternbusch wrote the prose Die Alexanderschlacht,[4] an important novel for the literary avant-garde of the time.[8] Achternbusch produced almost 30 low budget films.[9] He was often leading actor in his own films,[10] and worked together mainly with friends.[11] In 1975, Achternbusch met actor Josef Bierbichler, who played in 15 of his films, partly without salary.[12] Also notable were the actresses Annamirl Bierbichler [de] and Margarethe von Trotta,[13] as well as actor and painter Heinz Braun and cinematographer Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein.[14] In 1974, he made his film debut with Das Andechser Gefühl.[15] The 1977 film Bierkampf [de] (Beerfight) caused attention with numerous drunk Oktoberfest visitors as involuntary amateur actors.[4] Role models are the comedians Karl Valentin and Groucho Marx.[16][17][18] His anarchist surrealistic films are not known to a wide audience in Germany, although one of them, Das Gespenst (The Ghost), caused a scandal in 1983 because of its alleged blasphemous contents,[19] including a scene where Christ climbs down from the cross and later goes bathing with a nun.[15] Federal Minister of the Interior Friedrich Zimmermann halted the funding for the film as it was deemed to have violated the \"religious feeling of large parts of the population\".[4] For a long time, no public broadcaster showed any of Achternbusch's films.[20] Years of legal battle ensued, with Achternbusch finally winning in 1992.[11] In the 1983 film Der Depp, he had his favorite enemy Franz Josef Strauss poisoned.[6].\n",

He had a love-hate relationship with Bavaria which showed itself in his work. Some of his controversial films, such as Das Gespenst (The Ghost), were presented at the Berlinale festival.. Born Herbert Schild in 1938 in Munich,[2] Achternbusch was the illegitimate son of the sports teacher Luise Schild, née Muckenthaler, and the dental technician Adolf Achternbusch.[3] He grew up in the Bavarian Forest with his grandmother.[3][4] In 1960, he was adopted by his biological father and took the name Achternbusch.[5] After his Abitur in Cham,[6] he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg, and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.[4][7]. In the early 1970s, Achternbusch wrote the prose Die Alexanderschlacht,[4] an important novel for the literary avant-garde of the time.[8] Achternbusch produced almost 30 low budget films.[9] He was often leading actor in his own films,[10] and worked together mainly with friends.[11] In 1975, Achternbusch met actor Josef Bierbichler, who played in 15 of his films, partly without salary.[12] Also notable were the actresses Annamirl Bierbichler [de] and Margarethe von Trotta,[13] as well as actor and painter Heinz Braun and cinematographer Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein.[14] In 1974, he made his film debut with Das Andechser Gefühl.[15] The 1977 film Bierkampf [de] (Beerfight) caused attention with numerous drunk Oktoberfest visitors as involuntary amateur actors.[4] Role models are the comedians Karl Valentin and Groucho Marx.[16][17][18] His anarchist surrealistic films are not known to a wide audience in Germany, although one of them, Das Gespenst (The Ghost), caused a scandal in 1983 because of its alleged blasphemous contents,[19] including a scene where Christ climbs down from the cross and later goes bathing with a nun.[15] Federal Minister of the Interior Friedrich Zimmermann halted the funding for the film as it was deemed to have violated the \"religious feeling of large parts of the population\".[4] For a long time, no public broadcaster showed any of Achternbusch's films.[20] Years of legal battle ensued, with Achternbusch finally winning in 1992.[11] In the 1983 film Der Depp, he had his favorite enemy Franz Josef Strauss poisoned.[6].\n",

He is antagonized by Dib (Andy Berman), a young paranormal investigator who is determined to stop Zim from succeeding.. Nickelodeon contacted Jhonen Vasquez about pitching ideas for an animated series for their older demographic[13][14][15] and Invader Zim was the first thing he pitched. In Vasquez's words \"it went from pitch to series without hardly any waiting\".[16] As the series went on, ratings declined and budgetary issues became more frequent.[17] Before the second season was completed, Nickelodeon cancelled the series, leaving several episodes unfinished.[18] The show originally aired on Nickelodeon from 2001 to 2002,[17][11] with six of the completed second-season episodes initially going unreleased.\n",

The album was recorded between February 1989 and September 1991, with vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields leading sessions and experimenting with guitar vibrato, nonstandard tunings, digital samplers, and meticulous production methods.

They became influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two studio albums Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991), pioneering a subgenre known as shoegaze.[1] Shields's texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the \"glide guitar\" technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.[2]. Following My Bloody Valentine's dissolution in the late 1990s, Shields became a frequent guest musician, producer, engineer, and remixer with various bands and artists, including Experimental Audio Research, Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr, and Mogwai. In 1998 he became a touring member of Primal Scream. Shields contributed several original compositions to the soundtrack of Sofia Coppola's 2003 film Lost in Translation, which earned him nominations for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) awards.[3][4] In 2008, Shields released a collaborative live album together with Patti Smith entitled The Coral Sea..\n",

I need to search Fairbanks International Airport next.\nAction 2: Search[Fairbanks International Airport]\nObservation 2: Fairbanks International Airport (IATA: FAI, ICAO: PAFA, FAA LID: FAI) is a state-owned public-use airport located three miles (5 km) southwest of the central business district of Fairbanks, a city in the Fairbanks North Star Borough of the United States state of Alaska.[2] It is located in the South Van Horn census-designated place.[1] Fairbanks was the smallest city in the United States with regularly scheduled non-stop international flights, as Condor offered weekly flights to Frankfurt during the summer tourist season.[4] Air North is now the only international airline to offer scheduled charters with flights (to Canada).. The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield.[5] Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations.[6] By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day.[7] In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered \"interchange service\" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas.[8] In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.[9]. Pan American World Airways had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations.[10] Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of World War II, delayed these plans until decades later. Pan Am service to Fairbanks continued through the opening of FAI until 1965, when the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated Pan Am's rights to serve Alaska.[11].\n",

A combination of pink and white is associated with innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction.[5] In the 21st century, pink is seen as a symbol of femininity, though this has not always been true; in the 1920s, pink was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.[6]. The color pink is named after the flowers, pinks,[7] flowering plants in the genus Dianthus, and derives from the frilled edge of the flowers. The verb \"to pink\" dates from the 14th century and means \"to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern\" (possibly from German picken, \"to peck\").[8] It has survived to the current day in pinking shears, hand-held scissors that cut a zig-zagged line to prevent fraying.. The color pink has been described in literature since ancient times.\n",

Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art.. Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.[3] While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts.\n",

The show focuses on a dysfunctional Black American family, the Freemans, settling into the fictional, friendly and predominantly White suburb of Woodcrest.[2] The perspective offered by this mixture of cultures, lifestyles, social classes, stereotypes, viewpoints and racialized identities provides for much of the series' satire, comedy, and conflict.. The series ended its run on June 23, 2014, with a total of 55 episodes over the course of the show's four seasons, the last of which was produced without any involvement from McGruder, reportedly because \"a mutually agreeable production schedule could not be determined\".[3] The series also has aired in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media.. Widely regarded as one of the greatest animated series of all time,[4][5][6][7][8] The Boondocks has received several accolades including an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and a Peabody Award. On June 12, 2019, it was announced that Sony Pictures Animation would be producing a reboot of the television series that was set to premiere in 2022 with McGruder's involvement; John Witherspoon was also attached to the project to reprise his role as Robert Freeman before his passing on October 29, 2019.[9][10] On September 18, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had picked up the reboot with a two-season order.\n",

The show focuses on a dysfunctional Black American family, the Freemans, settling into the fictional, friendly and predominantly White suburb of Woodcrest.[2] The perspective offered by this mixture of cultures, lifestyles, social classes, stereotypes, viewpoints and racialized identities provides for much of the series' satire, comedy, and conflict.. The series ended its run on June 23, 2014, with a total of 55 episodes over the course of the show's four seasons, the last of which was produced without any involvement from McGruder, reportedly because \"a mutually agreeable production schedule could not be determined\".[3] The series also has aired in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media.. Widely regarded as one of the greatest animated series of all time,[4][5][6][7][8] The Boondocks has received several accolades including an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and a Peabody Award. On June 12, 2019, it was announced that Sony Pictures Animation would be producing a reboot of the television series that was set to premiere in 2022 with McGruder's involvement; John Witherspoon was also attached to the project to reprise his role as Robert Freeman before his passing on October 29, 2019.[9][10] On September 18, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had picked up the reboot with a two-season order.\n",

Instead of these popular approaches, he developed an eclectic theory based on traits.[1] He emphasized the uniqueness of each individual, and the importance of the present context, as opposed to history, for understanding the personality.. Allport had a profound and lasting influence on the field of psychology, even though his work is cited much less often than that of other well-known figures.[2] Part of his influence stemmed from his knack for exploring and broadly conceptualizing important topics (e.g. rumor, prejudice, religion, traits).\n",

In 2015, he and Louis Nirenberg were awarded the Abel Prize for their contributions to the field of partial differential equations.. As a graduate student in the Princeton University Department of Mathematics, Nash introduced a number of concepts (including Nash equilibrium and the Nash bargaining solution) which are now considered  central to game theory and its applications in various sciences. In the 1950s, Nash discovered and proved the Nash embedding theorems by solving a system of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in Riemannian geometry.\n",

It takes place in New York City in the 1990s and revisits some characters of the original, including Yossarian, Milo Minderbinder, and Chaplain Tappman.. The book has two stories that are interwoven throughout: that of Yossarian in the last stages of his life, and that of Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitz, two men from Coney Island who also fought in World War II (the Sammy Singer character makes a brief appearance in Catch-22 as the tailgunner aboard Yossarian's bomber who kept waking up and fainting when he saw Yossarian trying to attend to the wounds of Snowden).. As with Catch-22, the topic of death is omnipresent, only in this case from usually age-related illnesses, in particular cancer rather than dying in battle, as with its predecessor. One notable inconsistency in the book is that although Yossarian was 28 in Catch-22, which took place in 1944, in Closing Time Yossarian is 68, and the time of Catch-22 is referred to as \"50 years ago\".\n",

Alexander \"Sandy\" Calder was born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pennsylvania.[3] His birthdate remains a source of confusion. According to Calder's mother, Nanette (née Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22.

TNT ordered a pilot episode of The Great Escape from Imagine Entertainment in November 2010, with both Ron Howard and Brian Grazer serving as executive producers, and was considered an initial foray into the reality television market for the network.[5] Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri, the creators of The Amazing Race, were added as executive producers in mid-2011, prior to casting and filming of the pilot.[6] Subsequently, in January 2012, TNT announced that it has greenlit ten episodes (only airing nine of them) of The Great Escape, stating that the program has \"all the heart-pounding excitement and nail-biting suspense of a summer popcorn movie\".[7]. The show was produced as to create an experience for the players and the audience of being inside a movie; Howard noted that the elements of clues and puzzle-solving bring to mind his earlier films, The Da Vinci Code and Apollo 13.[8] After selecting a site, the route is carefully crafted as to keep contestants from going too far off the target course, particularly in dangerous environment such as a bayou. Production arrives about a week before filming to prepare the area and create any necessary props for the challenge or the course; in the case of the bayou, homemade shacks were constructed for the starting point for the teams.[8] Challenges are tested to make sure that they are doable within reasonable time prior to filming.[8] Contestant are given as much freedom as necessary to complete the game, with production stepping in only to stop players from certain actions.[8]. Each episode is a single competition among three teams of two contestants with a previous relationship, such as family relations, lifelong friends, or married or dating couples.\n",

Nirvana was formed in 1987 by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, with the position of drummer being filled by various musicians. The band released its debut album, Bleach, in 1989 on independent label Sub Pop. After being joined by final drummer Dave Grohl and signing to Geffen Records subsidiary DGC Records, the band released its second studio album, Nevermind, which became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990s[1][2] and popularized the Seattle grunge movement and alternative music.[3] The band's third album, In Utero, was also a commercial and critical success, though it did not match the sales precedent set by Nevermind—as the members of the band expected.[4] Nirvana disbanded in 1994 after the death of Cobain; since then several posthumous releases have been issued from the band, which once resulted in a legal conflict between Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, and the surviving members of the band over the release of the song \"You Know You're Right\".[5] In 2006, Love sold a significant share of the rights to Cobain's song catalog to Primary Wave Music Publishing.[6] Since its debut, the band has sold 27.6 million albums in the United States alone,[7] and over 75 million records worldwide.[8]. Courtney Love stated in May 2002 that she owned 109 unreleased tapes made by Cobain, with or without the other members of Nirvana.[121] Of these songs, many were released on the 61 song box set With the Lights Out in 2004, with three \"freshly unearthed\" songs appearing on the compilation Sliver: The Best of the Box in 2005.[122] More unreleased Nirvana tracks were released on the deluxe and super deluxe 20th anniversary editions of the Nevermind and In Utero albums in 2011 and 2013 respectively.[123][124][125] Many more unreleased songs were released on Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings in 2015 which was the companion soundtrack to the film Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck.[126] Brett Morgen stated that in Cobain's archive he discovered over 200 hours of audio on over 108 cassettes and that he thought the solo album \"would be a nice complement to the film\".[126].\n",

First known as a scrappy infielder who made considerable contributions to the championship Yankee teams of the 1950s, he then built a reputation as a manager who would initially make bad teams good, before ultimately being fired amid dysfunction. In each of his stints with the Yankees he managed them to winning records before being fired by team owner George Steinbrenner or resigning under fire, usually amid a well-publicized scandal such as Martin's involvement in an alcohol-fueled fight..

Damon's profile continued to expand in the 2000s, as he took on starring roles in two lucrative film franchises.[9] He played a con man in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Trilogy (2001–2007) and played the titular spy Jason Bourne in four films of the Bourne series (2002–2016).[10][11] Damon played an energy analyst in the thriller film Syriana (2005) and starred in Martin Scorsese's acclaimed crime film The Departed (2006).[12][13] He played the rugby player Francois Pienaar in the sports film Invictus (2009), gaining a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[14][15] Damon continued to gain praise for his collaborations with Soderbergh on the crime film The Informant!

According to the film's website, \"Marx Reloaded … examines the relevance of German socialist philosopher Karl Marx's ideas for understanding the global economic and financial crisis of 2008–09.\" The film also considers, in the context of an alleged revival of Marxist thinking, whether \"communism might provide the solution to the growing economic and environmental challenges facing the planet\".[7]. In an interview with Verso Books, writer-director Jason Barker described his intention in making the film \"to reload or reimagine Marx as a thinker, without the usual totalitarian moralising.\" Barker criticised the \"cliché\" according to which \"Marx's diagnoses of capitalism are validated whereas his 'prescription' of communism is rubbished on the grounds that it's 'utopian'.\" Asked whether the renewed popularity of Marx is evidence of a return of communism as a political force, or \"just the spectre of Marx haunting the academies\", Barker replied that \"political thinking today is again converging on precisely the type of social conditions in which Marx lived.\"[8].

Both songs, and others such as \"Godzilla\" (1977), remain classic rock radio staples.

The series follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law, he uses his skills from his former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve murders. The real reason for Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the serial killer, known as Red John, who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife, Angela Ruskin Jane, and his daughter, Charlotte Anne Jane.. Before the murders, Jane had a lucrative career as a con man, successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoyed near-celebrity status.\n",
